# ImageLink_Matcher
The Keypoint Vision Matcher is an advanced computer vision project designed to identify and match keypoints between a query image and a dataset of images, providing an efficient way to recognize images with similar features. This system utilizes the detection algorithm from scratch similar to SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm to detect distinctive keypoints in images and uses a custom matching algorithm to compare them. By applying feature detection techniques and homography estimation, the project enables precise matching of objects across different images, even in the presence of scale, rotation, or perspective changes.

The core features of this project include:

Keypoint Detection and Description: Extracts unique keypoints and descriptors from each image using SIFT.
Feature Matching: Matches query image features with those in the dataset using BFMatcher and Lowe's ratio test to filter the best matches.
Homography Estimation: Determines the geometric relationship between images, enabling the project to accurately overlay and align images.
Visualization: Draws and visualizes the matching keypoints between the query and the best-matching dataset image for a clear understanding of image similarity.
This project demonstrates the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques to solve real-world problems in image recognition, object detection, and image retrieval.
